PlasmidID is a mapping-based, assembly-assisted plasmid identification tool that analyzes and gives graphic solution for plasmid identification.

PlasmidID is a **computational pipeline** implemented in **BASH** that maps Illumina reads over plasmid database sequences. The most covered sequences are clustered by identity to avoid redundancy and the longest are used as scaffold for plasmid reconstruction. Reads are assembled and annotated. All information generated from mapping, assembly, annotation and local alignment analyses is gathered and accurately represented in a circular image which allow user to determine plasmidic composition in any bacterial sample.
